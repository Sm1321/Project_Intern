The KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) you are using in the bonus allocation project help optimize the decision-making process by identifying the customers who are most likely to benefit from a bonus.
These indicators provide insights into 
1.customer behavior and value,
2.helping allocate bonuses in a way that maximizes customer satisfaction, business revenue, and engagement.

->Here’s how each KPI contributes to the bonus allocation process:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Income Level
-------------------
How it helps:
-  Customers with higher income levels may have the capacity to place larger bets. 
- Offering bonuses to these customers could lead to higher engagement and more significant revenue generation.


2. Winning Percentage
-------------------
How it helps:
-  Customers with a high winning percentage are already engaged and motivated.
- A well-timed bonus could push them to increase their bets, generating more revenue for the business.

3. Days Since Last Bet
-------------------
How it helps:
-  If a customer hasn’t placed a bet in a while, offering a bonus could re-engage them, bringing them back to the platform.
- This helps in customer retention and increasing their activity.

4. Active Days.
-------------------
How it helps:
-  Customers who are consistently active may respond well to bonuses, which can keep them engaged and betting frequently.
- Rewarding these customers could help maintain their loyalty and betting patterns.

5. Total Number of Bets
-------------------
How it helps:
-  Customers who place many bets are typically highly engaged.
- A bonus might encourage them to bet even more, thereby increasing revenue.
- By identifying these customers, bonuses can be allocated more efficiently.


6. Total Amount Wagered
-------------------
How it helps:
-  This shows how much a customer bets over time.
- High-wagering customers are important to the business, and rewarding them with bonuses can strengthen their relationship with the platform, ensuring continued high-value betting activity.


7. Average Bet Amount
-------------------
How it helps:
-  Customers with higher average bet amounts might be incentivized to place even larger bets if given a bonus. This KPI helps in targeting high-value customers for better returns on bonus allocations.

8. Number of Bonuses Received
-------------------
How it helps:
-  This KPI helps track the customer’s history with bonuses. 
- If a customer has previously responded well to bonuses (i.e., increased betting after receiving one), it suggests that future bonuses would be effective too.

9. Amount of Bonuses Received
-------------------
How it helps: 
- This tracks how much value a customer has already received in bonuses.
- It helps in deciding whether to offer more or fewer bonuses to balance costs with returns.

10. Revenue from Bonuses
-------------------
How it helps: 
- This KPI helps assess whether the bonuses given have led to increased revenue.
- By tracking this, the model can focus on customers who have proven to generate revenue after receiving bonuses.

11. Increase in Bets After Bonus
-------------------
How it helps: 
- If a customer significantly increases their number of bets after receiving a bonus, it shows that bonuses are effective for them.
- This KPI helps prioritize customers who are likely to respond positively to future bonuses.

12. Increase in Wagering After Bonus
-------------------
How it helps: 
- If a customer’s wagering amount increases after receiving a bonus, it indicates the bonus's success in encouraging larger bets.
- This KPI helps in allocating bonuses to customers who are likely to bet more after receiving them.
