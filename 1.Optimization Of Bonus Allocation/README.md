# Optimization Of Bonous Allocation

Bonus Allocation Optimization Project Summary
____________________________________________________
- The project aims to optimize the process of allocating bonuses to customers, ensuring alignment with business goals such as maximizing customer satisfaction, increasing engagement, and driving profits.
- A machine learning model is built to predict which customers should receive bonuses based on key performance indicators (KPIs).

Key Steps Involved:
Data Analysis & Preprocessing:
- Analyzing customer data and preparing it by cleaning, handling outliers, and encoding categorical variables.

Key KPIs Used:
- Income Level: 
  - Identifying customers who can place larger bets.
- Winning Percentage:
  - Recognizing engaged customers who might increase activity with bonuses.
- Days Since Last Bet:
  -  Re-engaging inactive customers.
- Total Amount Wagered:
  - Targeting high-value customers.
    
- Number of Bonuses Received:
  - Ensuring bonuses are effective in driving future bets.
Machine Learning Models: Models like Random Forest, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting are used to predict whether a customer should receive a bonus based on these KPIs.

Outcome:
- The model helps the business allocate bonuses effectively, boosting customer retention, engagement, and profitability while minimizing costs.

Business Problem:
The company faces inefficiencies in its bonus allocation process, leading to suboptimal use of 
resources and customer dissatisfaction. The current method does not align bonus distribution with 
key performance indicators (KPIs) and business goals, resulting in higher costs and lower customer 
motivation. An efficient system is needed to allocate bonuses that maximize customer performance 
and satisfaction while staying within budget constraints.

Business Objective:
1. Maximize customer satisfaction.
2. Minimize variance in bonus distribution.

Business Constraint:
- Maximize fairness in bonus distribution.

Success Criteria:

 - Business Success Criteria: Achieve a 10% increase in profit margins through optimized bonus 
allocation.

- Machine Learning Success Criteria: Achieve an accuracy of at least 95%.

- Economic Success Criteria: Generate a 20% increase in revenue from the solution within the 
first year of implementation
